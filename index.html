    <p style="color:white">This is a random website, I don't know why you came here. There is nothing here, as I don't really know what I want to put here. I guess that I can just put some images when I get bored, maybe a few links. This website is random and useless to anyone that comes here, but if you want to then you can click on the image that I have below. I don't really know what is going to happen if you click that image, but it is almost certain that it won't be anything dangerous, meaning that you are safe. Well bye I guess, and if you want you can click that image. There might be something cool under there.
